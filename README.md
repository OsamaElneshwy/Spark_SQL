## To answer some questions:
- read josn file
- Display part of the data and schema

## Using SQL:
- Create Temp View
- Display "RAM"column and count "RAM" column
- Get all columns when "Year" column equal 2015
- Get all when "Model" start with "M"
- Get all data when "Model" column equal "MacBook Pro"
- Get all data with Multiple Conditions when "RAM" column equal "8GB" and "Model" column is "Macbook"
- Get all data with Multiple Conditions when "D" greater than or equal "8" and "Model" column is "iMac"
